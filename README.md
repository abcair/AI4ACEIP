## AI4ACEIPï¼š A Computing Tool to Identify Food Peptides with High Inhibitory Activity for ACE by Merged Molecular Representation and Rich Intrinsic Sequence Information Based on Ensemble Learning Strategy 
### Hypertension, a widespread chronic condition and a key contributor to cardiovascular diseases, is often managed by inhibiting the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). This enzyme converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II, leading to vasoconstriction and increased blood pressure. While pharmacotherapy is the standard treatment, it can cause adverse effects. Food-derived ACE-inhibiting peptides (ACEIP) present a promising alternative with fewer side effects. Our study introduces AI4ACEIP, a cutting-edge model designed to identify ACEIP in food using a two-layer stacked ensemble architecture and features from sequence, language models, and molecular data. We found that certain feature pairs, such as (AAindex1, Prot-t5_xl_bfd), (ESM2, Prot-t5_xl_uniref50), (Prot-t5_xl_uniref50, RdkitDescriptors), and (Prot-t5_xl_bfd, PubChem10M), significantly enhance ACEIP prediction performance. The PowerShap feature selection method was employed to choose 40 optimal feature and meta model combinations, resulting in AI4ACEIP outperforming existing methods by 5-20%. This reliable prediction model, AI4ACEIP, is available for public access at https://github.com/abcair/AI4ACEIP.
